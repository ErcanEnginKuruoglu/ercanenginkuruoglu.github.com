<ul>
<li><p>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful radar technology commonly adopted for airborne and spaceborne 
geo-sensing and mapping applications due to its significant advantages in high azimuthal resolution and weather-independent 
operations. Upon acquisition of SAR images, a histogram representing the distribution of the image pixel values is drafted, 
and a proper model is required to obtain precise knowledge of the statistical properties of the image data to 
characterize the surface on which the image is produced. 

</p>
</li>
<li><p>Several models have been established to approach SAR image data with considerable success, but they are either empirical models 
with little theoretical support, or theoretical models based on the assumption of an area consisting of infinitesimal reflectors. 
Such models tend to fail at modelling heavy-tailed scenarios like urban districts with countless buildings and cars that 
contribute to a heterogeneous collection of strong reflectance.

</p>
</li>
<li><p>We thereby aim to develop a unique set of SAR image models based on the Levy α-stable distribution as suggested by the Generalized 
Central Limit Theorem. Such models enjoy both sufficient theoretical support and availability to strongly heterogeneous data 
populations, enabling them with arguable competitivity in the analysis of SAR image data and other complex image signals.
